🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design and develop a Parking Slot Allocation System using Java that demonstrates the practical implementation of core backend concepts. This project aims to simulate a real-world parking management scenario where vehicles can be allocated and released from parking slots efficiently.

The system is developed to showcase:

Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and exception handling

Servlet-based web application development for handling client requests

JDBC connectivity for database operations

Use of collections and synchronization for managing parking slots

Multithreading to simulate automated background tasks

A simple GUI interface to enhance user interaction

This project is built as an academic submission to demonstrate understanding of Java enterprise application development concepts following a standard Maven web application structure.
